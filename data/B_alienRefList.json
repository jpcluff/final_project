Befflem (plural) are described as having armored hides and possessing stumpy legs despite their agility. They are generally playful and agreeable and make an endearing squeaking noise, but their aggressiveness should not be underestimated: When cornered by another animal, they do quite well for themselves in a fight. Threats include tsiongi and prey include domestic cats and dogs. On Home, there were regulations against letting unleashed befflem run free. On Tosev 3 (Earth), such regulations were uncommon as befflem were much more inclined to do what they wanted than what the Race wanted them to do. They would adapt well on Earth, making many smaller native animals its prey. They also treated human masters the same as any of the Race.","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/2-alien.png"},{"name":"Beings of the Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race","source":"Muv-Luv","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Benjari","source":"Battlelords of the 23rd Century","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/2-alien.png"},{"name":"Benzite","source":"Star Trek","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Berellian","source":"Star Trek","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/3-alien.png"},{"name":"Berserkers","source":"Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/3-alien.png"},{"name":"Berubelan","source":"Anachronox","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/2-alien.png"},{"name":"Besalisk","source":"Star Wars","overview":"Four arms","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/3-alien.png"},{"name":"Betazoid","source":"Star Trek","overview":"Empathic humanoids","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Bgztl","source":"DC Comics Legion of Super-Heroes","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/2-alien.png"},{"name":"Bioroids","source":"Intense Stories","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Bith","source":"Star Wars","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/4-alien.png"},{"name":"Bismollian","source":"DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/4-alien.png"},{"name":"Bjorn","source":"Space Quest","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/2-alien.png"},{"name":"Black Arms","source":"Shadow the Hedgehog","overview":"Humanoid","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/3-alien.png"},{"name":"Black Cloud","source":"Fred Hoyle","overview":"Interstellar dust cloud","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Black Oil","source":"The X-Files","overview":"","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/1-alien.png"},{"name":"Blastaar","source":"Marvel Comics","overview":"Native of the Negative Zone","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/3-alien.png"},{"name":"Blathereen","source":"Doctor Who","overview":"Raxacoricofallapatorian","imgOverview":"images/placeholderImg/4-alien.png"},{"name":"Blisk","source":"Destroy All Humans! 2","overview":"Bipedal, armoured crustaceans with a hive mind and a dependence on radiation.
